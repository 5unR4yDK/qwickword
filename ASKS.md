# Quick Word — Things I need from Andreas

The nightly build task appends here whenever it hits something it can't (or shouldn't) do on its own.
Check this each morning. Clearing these unblocks the next night's progress.

## Open
- [ ] **(Recommended, low urgency) Rotate the Daily API key.** The current key was pasted into a
      chat transcript on 2026-07-12, so best practice is to regenerate it in the Daily dashboard
      (Developers) and replace the value in `.env.local`. One-line swap. Not blocking the build.

## Done
- 2026-07-12 — Daily.co account created, domain `quickword.daily.co`, API key added to `.env.local`.
- 2026-07-20 — Vercel deploy approved in chat ("ok to deploy ok to make new vercel project"); Andreas
  pointed the run at the folder holding his Vercel account token. Deployed to a brand-new project,
  `quickword`, live at **https://quickword.vercel.app**. Used the same `DAILY_API_KEY`/`DAILY_DOMAIN`
  values already in `.env.local` (no rotation) and the default `*.vercel.app` domain (no custom domain
  set up). See STATUS.md/ROADMAP.md item 9 for full detail.
