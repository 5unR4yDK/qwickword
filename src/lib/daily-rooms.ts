// Server-only helper for creating hard-expiring Daily rooms. This is the first
// real caller of daily-config.ts's mock-mode fallback: in live mode it calls the
// real Daily REST API, in mock mode it fabricates an equivalent response so the
// rest of the app (link generator, call page) can be built and tested without a
// live key.
//
// Property names below (`exp`, `eject_at_room_exp`, `eject_after_elapsed`) were
// validated on 2026-07-15 against the live Daily REST API reference
// (https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/create-room and
// https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/config). They match what
// BUILD_PLAN.md already specified — no correction needed there.
//
// `enable_prejoin_ui` (added 2026-07-21, ROADMAP.md Phase 1 item 1 — "Pre-join
// screen: name entry + camera/mic check before connecting") was validated the
// same way against https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/config:
// "Determines whether participants enter a waiting room with a camera, mic,
// and browser check before joining a call." That IS Daily Prebuilt's own
// lobby screen — confirmed via docs.daily.co/guides/products/prebuilt/
// customizing-daily-prebuilt and Daily's own blog that it also collects a
// display name first ("the name form will show, which requires a name to be
// entered, and submitting this form will bring the user to the prejoin UI").
// Deliberate build choice: rather than writing a custom getUserMedia-based
// name/device screen, this reuses Daily Prebuilt's own lobby — same rationale
// as Phase 0 item 5's choice to embed Daily's whole prebuilt call UI rather
// than build a custom call surface. Consequence worth knowing: the lobby is
// rendered *inside* the iframe already embedded on the call page, so no new
// component/route was needed here, and it counts against the room's shared
// `exp` like any other time spent on the page (consistent with "the timer
// hits zero and it ends" — dawdling in the lobby is not a loophole).
//
// Hard-expiry design (per STATUS.md, locked): `exp = now + duration`,
// `eject_at_room_exp: true` (ejects anyone still in the room at `exp`), and
// `eject_after_elapsed = duration` as a per-participant backstop (ejects a
// participant `duration` seconds after *they* joined, even if that's before the
// room-level `exp` — e.g. a latecomer). Both are enforced server-side by Daily,
// so there is no client-side "extend" bypass.
//
// "Anchor the countdown to first join, not link creation" (ROADMAP.md, built
// 2026-07-21, interactive): the real countdown no longer begins the instant
// `POST /api/rooms` is called. Instead:
//  1. `createHardExpiryRoom` sets the room's *initial* `exp` to a generous
//     `PRE_START_BUFFER_SECONDS` (24h) buffer, not `now + durationSeconds` —
//     this is purely "how long the link can sit unopened before it rots,"
//     not the actual call length. `eject_after_elapsed` is set to the same
//     generous buffer, so nobody waiting in the pre-join lobby gets ejected
//     early by that per-participant backstop.
//  2. `startRoomCountdown` is the one place that starts the *real* clock: it
//     re-fetches the room's live config from Daily, and if the room hasn't
//     already been started (see `isCountdownStarted`'s heuristic below), sets
//     `exp = now + durationSeconds` — the real, server-enforced hard cutoff.
//     If it's already started, it's a no-op that just echoes the existing
//     `exp` back — this is what makes "whichever trigger fires first wins"
//     safe to call from both paths (a manual "Start now" click, and every
//     connected client's own daily-js detecting a second participant) without
//     a race resetting the clock.
//  3. There is still no datastore. "Started or not" is derived entirely from
//     the room's own live `exp` versus `PRE_START_BUFFER_SECONDS` — Daily's
//     room object stays the single source of truth, exactly as ROADMAP.md
//     specified, rather than adding a database for one boolean.
const PRE_START_BUFFER_SECONDS = 24 * 60 * 60; // 24 hours

// How far below PRE_START_BUFFER_SECONDS the remaining time has to be before
// we call the countdown "started." Real countdowns are at most
// MAX_DURATION_SECONDS (60 minutes) away, so anything meaningfully less than
// the 24h buffer is unambiguously a real countdown, not the pre-start buffer
// — this margin just absorbs request latency/clock skew, not actual
// ambiguity between the two.
